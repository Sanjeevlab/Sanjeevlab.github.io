{% capture biomarker_desc %}
This project is sponsored by the *Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)*:
- Proposes an n-cylindrical biomarker by combining Eigen Value Decomposition, FFT, and DWT for interictal epilepsy diagnosis.
- Serves as an assistive tool in doubtful epilepsy cases where MRI and video EEG are normal.
- Introduces a novel ICMR-Epilepsy clinical EEG dataset of 140 subjects (70 epileptic, 70 healthy control).
- Outperforms benchmarks on Siena, CHB-MIT, and Bonn datasets.

{% capture ht_plv_desc %}
Sponsored by *ICMR*, this project develops a novel ht-PLV (ht-Phase Locking Value) feature:
- ht-PLV feature fed into deep learning models to analyze functional connectivity.
- Helps in doubtful cases where MRI and EEG are normal.
- Contributes a novel ICMR Epilepsy-Mimicker EEG dataset (50 epileptic, 50 mimickers).
- Outperforms benchmarks on Siena dataset.

{% capture meg_mri_desc %}
Using data from the **BIOMAG-2022 International Data Analysis Competition**:
- Applies LCMV beamforming and kurtosis to localize epileptic hub nodes with sublobar resolution.
- Proposes a pipeline to compute nodal strength of hub nodes over time.
- Studies the network dynamics of epileptic hubs.

{% capture cogitate_desc %}
As part of the **BIOMAG-2024 Cogitate Connectivity Challenge**:
- Localized conscious content in alpha, beta, and gamma bands using the DICS beamforming technique.
- Proposed a pipeline for network connectivity and hub node identification of conscious states.
