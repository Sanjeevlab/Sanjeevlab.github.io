## About me
***  
I am a doctoral researcher in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIT Roorkee under the supervision of [Prof. Tharun Kumar Reddy Bollu](https://tharuniitk.github.io/). My current research focuses on Neurological disorder diagnosis and detection using ML and DL models. During my research I designed computational biomarkers and features which assisted in initial screening of Epileptic subjects from Epilepsy Immitators. 

Additionally I have hands-on experience and interest in designing and implementing a pipeline for Neurological disorder localisation and brain mapping using MEG-fMRI modality. In the exploratory stage I am working on implementing Neurofeedback techniques for neuro rehablitation.

## Work Details
***  
**Development of a novel biomarker for Epilepsy diagnosis and Seizure detection over interictal Epileptic Patients and Healthy Control via EEG Modality.**

This project is sponsored by the *Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)*, whose key contributions are as follows:  
- This study proposes an n-cylindrical biomarker by combining the advancement of Eigen Value Decomposition, FFT, and DWT for interictal epilepsy diagnosis.
- The proposed nCSR biomarker serves as an assistive tool in diagnosing, especially in the doubtful cases of epilepsy, where MRI and video EEG come out to be normal.  
- This study contributes a novel ICMR-Epilepsy clinical EEG dataset of 140 subjects (70 interictal epileptic and 70 healthy control) collected at Max Superspeciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi.  
- The proposed biomarker outperforms the existing benchmark algorithms in the study of seizure detection when applied over a publicly available Siena Dataset, CHB-MIT dataset and Bonn dataset.

**Development of a novel feature for Epilepsy diagnosis and Seizure detection over interictal Epileptic Patients and interictal Epilepsy Imitators (Mimickers) via EEG Modality.**

This project is sponsored by the *Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)*, whose key contributions are as follows:  
- This study proposes a novel ht-PLV (ht-Phase Locking Value) as a feature given to DL model that analyzes the functional connectivity among the nodes to diagnose epilepsy from the mixed population of epileptics and mimickers.
- The proposed ht-PLV (ht-Phase Locking Value biomarker serves as an assistive tool in diagnosing, especially in the doubtful cases of epilepsy, where MRI and video EEG come out to be normal.
- This study contributes a novel ICMR Epilepsy-Mimicker clinical EEG dataset of 100 subjects (50 interictal epileptic and 50 interictal mimickers) collected at Max Superspeciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi.
- The proposed feature outperforms the existing benchmark algorithms in the study of seizure detection when applied over a publicly available Siena Dataset.

**Localization of Epileptic sites with sublobar resolution over resting-state MEG-MRI modalities and finding the network connectivity among the hub nodes.**

The MEG-MRI dataset was provided by the *International Data Analysis Comptetion* organised by **BIOMAG-2022**. Key contributions are as follows:  
- This study uses LCMV beamforming and kurtosis to localize epileptic hub nodes in the sublobar region successfully.
- This study proposes a method pipeline to find out the nodal strength of the hub nodes with respect to time.
- This study finds out the network dynamics of the epileptic nodes and hub nodes.

**Cogitate Connectivity Challenge, where we have to analyze the data to determine which theory best suits explaining consciousness. Is it GNWT or IIT?**

This project was a part of the **BIOMAG-2024** Challenge; key contributions are as follows:  
- This study successfully localizes conscious content in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands using the DICS beamforming technique.
- This study provides a novel pipeline based on the DICS beamforming technique to perform network connectivity or hub node identification of the conscious content in alpha, beta, and gamma bands.

**Proposed a novel WearNeuroNet architecture along with the implementation of explainable AI, i.e., layerwise relevance propagation for ictal-interictal classification limited channel EEG wearables.**
