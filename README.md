### About me
***  
I am a doctoral researcher in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIT Roorkee under the supervision of [Prof. Tharun Kumar Reddy Bollu](https://tharuniitk.github.io/). My current research focuses on Neurological disorder diagnosis and detection using ML and DL models. During my research I designed computational biomarkers and features which assisted in initial screening of Epileptic subjects from Epilepsy Immitators. 

Additionally I have hands-on experience and interest in designing and implementing a pipeline for Neurological disorder localisation and brain mapping using MEG-fMRI modality. In the exploratory stage I am working on implementing Neurofeedback techniques for neuro rehablitation.

### Work Details
***  
**Development of a novel biomarker for Epilepsy diagnosis and Seizure detection over interictal Epileptic Patients and Healthy Control via EEG Modality.**

*This project is sponsored by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), whose key contributions are as follows:*  
- This study proposes an n-cylindrical biomarker by combining the advancement of Eigen Value Decomposition, FFT, and DWT for interictal epilepsy diagnosis.
- The proposed nCSR biomarker serves as an assistive tool in diagnosing, especially in the doubtful cases of epilepsy, where MRI and video EEG come out to be normal.  
- This study contributes a novel ICMR-Epilepsy clinical EEG dataset of 140 subjects (70 interictal epileptic and 70 healthy control) collected at Max Superspeciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi.  
- The proposed biomarker outperforms the existing benchmark algorithms in the study of seizure detection when applied over a publicly available Siena Dataset and Bonn dataset.

**Development of a novel feature for Epilepsy diagnosis and Seizure detection over interictal Epileptic Patients and interictal Epilepsy Imitators (Mimickers) via EEG Modality.**
