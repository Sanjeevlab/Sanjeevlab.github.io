### About me
I am a doctoral researcher in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIT Roorkee under the supervision of Prof. Tharun Kumar Reddy Bollu (https://tharuniitk.github.io/). My current research focuses on Neurological disorder diagnosis and detection using ML and DL models. During my research I designed computational biomarkers and features which assisted in initial screening of Epileptic subjects from Epilepsy Immitators. Additionally I have hands-on experience and interest in designing and implementing a pipeline for Neurological disorder localisation and brain mapping using MEG-fMRI modality. In the exploratory stage I am working on implementing Neurofeedback techniques for neuro rehablitation.
