   title="Development of a novel biomarker for Epilepsy diagnosis and Seizure detection" 
   img="/assets/img/research1.jpg"
%}
This project is sponsored by the *Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)*:
- Proposes an n-cylindrical biomarker combining EVD, FFT, and DWT.
- Assistive tool for doubtful cases where MRI and EEG are normal.
- Novel dataset of 140 subjects (70 epileptic, 70 healthy).
- Outperforms benchmarks on Siena, CHB-MIT, and Bonn datasets.

   title="Novel ht-PLV Feature for Epilepsy vs Mimickers" 
   img="/assets/img/research2.jpg"
%}
- Develops ht-PLV feature fed into deep learning for functional connectivity.
- Helps diagnose doubtful cases where MRI/EEG are normal.
- Dataset: 100 subjects (50 epileptic, 50 mimickers).
- Outperforms benchmarks on Siena dataset.
